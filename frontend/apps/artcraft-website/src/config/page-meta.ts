// Single source of truth for per-page SEO + social-share metadata.
//
// This is consumed in TWO places, so it must stay framework-agnostic (no
// React, no Vite `import.meta`, no DOM access):
//   1. Runtime — the <Seo> component reads it to set document.title and meta
//      tags after the SPA hydrates (good for users navigating client-side).
//   2. Build time — scripts/prerender-meta.mjs reads it to bake a static
//      index.html per route with real <title>/<meta>/og:/twitter: tags, so
//      social crawlers (Discord, Slack, X, iMessage…) that DON'T run JS still
//      get the correct preview for each page.
//
// To give a new marketing route its own share preview: add an entry to
// PAGE_META keyed by its pathname, then make sure scripts/prerender-meta.mjs
// emits it (it iterates PAGE_META) and _redirects points the route at the
// prerendered file.

// Canonical production origin (no trailing slash). Used to build absolute
// og:url / og:image URLs, which crawlers require — relative paths are ignored.
